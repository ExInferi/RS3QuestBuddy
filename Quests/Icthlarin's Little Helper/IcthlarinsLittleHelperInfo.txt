After returning the canopic jar and talking to the priest, you can enter the city through the front gate, so you can use the magic carpet transport system.`
It is possible to get out of the city without purposely dying, finishing the quest, or using a teleport. There is a small crack in the north-eastern corner of the wall near the locust. You can re-enter the city from the secret passage north-east of where the quest started, directly north-east of the tent where the wanderer is.`
2-3 waterskins are recommended. You will not need water within the city, and there are places to fill your water.`
Note that wearing a lot of weight will make you die faster in the desert. Take this into account- bring more waterskins if you are bringing a lot of armour and weapons with you.`
Note that jumping the pit is risky. You will not always make it, even if you have 100 run energy. A higher Agility level is recommended.`
The level 56 Possessed Priest and one of Apmeken, Het, Crondis or Scabaras are not hard to defeat with the help of prayer.`
Bring a bucket of sap to minimise running/teleporting back and forth.`

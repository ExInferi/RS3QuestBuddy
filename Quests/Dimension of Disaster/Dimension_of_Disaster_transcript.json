    "Well done, hero of two worlds. I knew you would fulfill[sic] your destiny. You have accomplished great deeds \u2013 although only you and I will ever know.",
    "I cannot begin to imagine what a world ruled by Zemouregal must have been like.",
    "Hmmm, I wonder. If there\u2019s an alternative reality where Zemouregal rules, there must be one where you rule.",
    "Let me close my eyes and connect with this world. I should be able to view it, if only for a moment\u2026",
    "I see a just world, where evil is punished and the good are rewarded. There is little fear here.",
    "Money is not a worry for the people of this world. They get what they need and never complain.",
    "I have two services I can provide to you. Firstly, I have the power to reset your progress in the quest you have just completed. It will be as if your adventure had never begun. Not even I will recognize the great deed you have just accomplished. However, you will be able to return to New Varrock. Completing your journey anew will increase your understanding of the other world and your own nature. This journey of self-reflection will earn you silver pennies. With silver pennies you can purchase rewards from me, drawn from your memories of New Varrock. Choose wisely. Silver pennies are precious, and some rewards will only aid you in your journey through New Varrock."
